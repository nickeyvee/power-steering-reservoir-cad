# power-steering-reservoir-cad

Attempt to create a lower-profile version of the existing power steering reservoir for the 2002-2006 Acura RSX (DC5). Based on some rough measurements of the OEM part with some modifications. This version would provide clearance for a larger aftermarket passenger-side engine mount without having to use a riser for the power steering reservoir bracket.
